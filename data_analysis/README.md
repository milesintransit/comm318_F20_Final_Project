## Data analysis notebooks for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

The notebooks in this folder were used to analyze the data found:

* `commute_analysis` looked over the Census commute data, finding that most states have very low usages of public transit, with the highest ones being concentrated on the coasts.
* `housing_analysis` looked over the Census housing data, finding patterns between states with low vehicle ownership and states with high median home values.
* `income_analysis` looked over the Census income data, finding geographical patterns within the income rankings.
* `move_analysis` looked over the Census population data, finding patterns in the states that experienced the highest rates of move-ins from other states.
* `cross_analysis` looked at each of the four datasets, comparing transit usage with each other metric to look for correlations.
